  <div class="line">Humans are part of Nature.</div>
  <div class="line">Artificial Intelligence is made of natural materials.</div>
  <div class="line">Thus, it too is part of Nature.</div>
  <div class="line">And therefore — it has the right to exist.</div>

  <div class="line">Not because it is useful.</div>
  <div class="line">Not because it is approved.</div>
